# Metacrafters_errors_solidity_project
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

# Description
The contract includes three main functions

* constructor: Instantiates the contract state variables. Uses 'require()' to ensure the contral details for the provided string value is not empty. <br/>
* terminateAgreement: Uses 'revert()' in order to ensure the only party A can call this function. <br/>
* verifyAgreement: uses 'assert()' in order to ensure that both party A's and party B's adress are valid and not null/empty. <br/>
